I wanted to become more secure online, and how do you do that? By creating harder to guess passwords! 
These passwords are often hard to remember though, so I thought it would be fun to try and create a password manager in C#. 
It's one of my first big projects in C# and it'll probably suck, but im still trying to make it uncrackable. 

Download it and try to crack it (give me feedback if you succeed).
